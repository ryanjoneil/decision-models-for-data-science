      "### 2.1. Putting it all together\n",
      "\n",
      "In this chapter we demonstrate how to formulate and solve the complete scheduling problem for next Monday. We start by rpresenting the model in purely mathematical notation. Recall that our model consists of three major components: decision variables, an objective function on those variables, and a set of constraints relating and limiting the activities prescribed by the variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\max z = 1.5 x_s + x_w + 2 x_l$$\n",
      "$$x_s + x_w + x_l = 24$$\n",

      "$$7 \\le x_s \\le 24$$\n",
      "$$0 \\le x_l \\le 24$$\n",
      "\n",
      "This is nothing more than a consolidated form of the equations and inequalities we wrote in the last chapter. We have three variables, corresponding to the amount of time we sleep, work, and play during the course of a day. Each activity has a different per-hour payoff, or _utility_. We maximize the total utility of our schedule such that our schedule comprises exactly 24 hours, and we respect certain minimum hours of activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resulting formulation is a very simple example of a _linear model_. In much of the literature on decision making, this is referred to as a _linear program_, but the term _program_ has become a confusing historical anachronism which we shall avoid. The important part is not its name but its structure. Any mathematical model that exhibits the same set of certain characteristics will also be a linear model. So let's state in high-level terms what those characteristics are.\n",
      "\n",
      "* A finite set of variables that take real values. This means that we have a known number of decision variables that are _continuous_. That is, they can take values over some range and anywhere in between. We can sleep for 7 hours, 8 hours, 8.5 hours, 8.25 hours, and so on. Any division of that time is possible. We'll usually assume that our decision variables are nonnegative. In specific cases we may also state that they are _unrestricted in sign_ (urs).<br><br>\n",
      "* An objective function which is some _linear combination_ of these variables. The function can either minimize or maximize, and it need not include every variable. This translates to the sum of each variable and a known coefficient. It can also be thought of as the _dot product_ of a real-valued vector and our vector of decision variables.<br><br>\n",
      "* A set of constraints which are linear equalities or inequalities of the decision variables. These constraints can take any of the three forms $=$, $\\le$, or $\\ge$. We'll see that these forms are equivalent in short order.\n",
      "\n",
      "These characteristics combine to give us a general form for linear models. Any linear optimization problem can be stated mathematically with the following structure, where $c$ and $b$ are known vectors of reals, $x$ is a vector of decision variables, and $A$ is a known matrix of reals.\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\max c^\\intercal x$$\n",
      "$$A x = b$$\n",
      "$$x \\ge 0$$\n",
      "\n",
      "We won't worry about the particular dimensions of our model at the moment. The important thing to note is that our scheduling problem is written can be written in this form. Thus it is one instance of the set of linear models. Further, there are infinitely many possible versions of our scheduling problem, and each one is itself a linear model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking about the algebraic structure of our problem in this manner allows us to effectively separate data from logic. This makes our model more powerful. It enables us to gain insights about our problem that we might not otherwise be able to. It also means that we can reuse any existing tools and techniques that apply to the class _(or classes)_ that our probem belongs to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ability to thing about the general structures of problems instead of their individual implementations is key to building successful models. A good model can be used to reason about general classes of problems and used to provide decision making guidance. Thus the real meat of modeling is often in formulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a brief aside, recall that our scheduling problem has constraints of the form $a_i^\\intercal x = b_i$ and $a_i^\\intercal x \\le b_i$. We state that the forms $\\le$, $\\ge$ and $=$ are equivalent. Why is this so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Say we have some linear inequality $a_i^\\intercal x \\le b_i$ in a model, and a feasible solution $\\bar{x}$ to that model. Since $\\bar{x}$ is feasible, we know it must satisfy the inequality. Thus there are two options. Either $a_i^\\intercal \\bar{x} = b_i$ or $a_i^\\intercal \\bar{x} < b_i$. In the former case, the constraint is _binding_, and we can simply represent it using an $=$ sign. In the latter, it is _nonbinding_ and we have some amount of positive _slack_ between $a_i^\\intercal \\bar{x}$ and $b_i$. Thus, in either case there must be some value $s_i \\ge 0$ such that $a_i^\\intercal \\bar{x} + s_i = b_i$.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of inequalities of the form $a_j^\\intercal x \\ge b_j$, we make the same argument in the opposite direction. For any feasible $\\bar{x}$ we can add a variable $e_j \\ge 0$ such that $a_j^\\intercal \\bar{x} - e_j = b_j$. $e_j$ represents the amount of excess we have with respect to the constraint. $s_i$ and $e_j$ are simply extra nonnegative decision variables that we add in with our existing variables which convert inequalities into equalities. We can think of them as the decisions to not be bound by certain constraints. For instance, we may decide to sleep more than our minimum required amount. The decision would result in a schedule with excess sleep, which actually sounds rather nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Introducing PuLP\n",
      "\n",
      "It's time to take our purely mathematical scheduling model and solve it on a computer. To do this we'll use the Python library PuLP, which provides a clean interface for linear model with both open source and commercial linear optimizers. A linear optimizer is a program that takes a model definition and its associated data as input, and provides an optimal solution as output.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of optimizers available, and the choice of optimizer depends on one's needs. Some of the better known open source linear optimizers include the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK), COIN-OR Linear Programming (CLP), and lpsolve. Open source solvers are nice since they are free and provide their source code, but do not typically perform as well as commercial solvers, such as CPLEX, Gurobi, Sulum, MOSEK, and others. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each solver has different strengths and a different modeling interface, so a nice thing about a tool like PuLP is that it abstracts the ability to model across many solvers. This allows us to focus on modeling instead of logistical issues of targeting individual solvers. All the linear model examples in this book are intended to run using either GLPK or CLP. But they can just as easily be run with any other solver that PuLP supports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below we give our implementation of the model in PuLP. Its structure is very similar to our mathematical formulations of the same model. We create a problem called `schedule` which attempts to maximize an objective called `happiness`. Our decision variables are defined as Python variables with the names `sleep`, `work`, and `lesiure`. Lower and upper bounds for these variables are passed as the second and third arguments to `pulp.LpVariable`, respectively."

So far we have seen models that are feasible with an optimal solution and models that are infeasible and therefore have no solution. It is also possible that a model is feasible but has no optimal solution. This situation is called _unboundedness_ and occurs when some action that gives us a payoff has no limit. That is, say we sell widgets and can get \\$1 for each widget we sell. There is no limit on the number of widgets that can be sold, and they cost nothing, or at least less than \\$1, to produce. Obviously, we should produce an infinite number of widgets and then have more money than exists in the world.\n",
